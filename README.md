About this project
===================
This project was heavily inspired by a concept design called "Simply Login" [I found](https://dribbble.com/shots/1892468-simply-login) on Dribbble. It was made possible for WinForms by designing a bunch of custom, fully functional controls with GDI+ and cramming them into one form to produce an excellent result. Eye candy, eh?
